## Formatting Rules
- Keep placeholders unchanged across locales: `{{name}}`, `{{page}}`, `{{total}}`.
- Prefer concise labels in tables/buttons to avoid clipping in RTL.
- For currencies, use locale formatter and keep currency code explicit where needed (e.g. `JOD`).
- For mixed-script strings (English IDs inside Arabic), keep punctuation direction-safe.
